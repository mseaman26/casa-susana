            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>At Casa Susana, our journey began with a shared passion for authentic Mexican cuisine and a vision to create a place where people could experience the vibrant flavors and rich traditions of Mexico right here in Kentfield, CA, and Parker, Colorado. Our founders drew inspiration from their travels through Mexico, where they fell in love with the diverse regional dishes, warm hospitality, and the lively spirit of fiestas.</p>

<p>In 2016, a culinary adventure began, bringing the essence of Mexico to our charming Kentfield location. With a commitment to using only the freshest ingredients and time-honored family recipes, we soon became a beloved fixture in the local community. The warm ambiance, colorful decor, and the sound of sizzling fajitas quickly made us a gathering place for friends and families.</p>

<p>Our success in Kentfield led us to expand our flavors to the welcoming community of Parker, Colorado, in 2019. We were welcomed with open arms, and we've been serving mouthwatering tacos, zesty enchiladas, and refreshing margaritas ever since.</p>

<p>Today, Casa Susana is a celebration of the vibrant Mexican culture, where every dish is a tribute to the heritage, and every guest becomes a part of our extended familia. Whether you're joining us in Kentfield or Parker, we invite you to savor the tastes, aromas, and warmth of Mexico with each visit.</p>

<p>Thank you for being a part of our story, and we look forward to serving you for many more years to come!</p>
